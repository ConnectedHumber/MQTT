# Proposed Database Changes October 2019

## Add new device class table linked to the devices  

  This will allow the map to display different types of sensors and the heading to change accordingly.

  At this time the device classes will be 'Environment Sensor' (formerly AQ sensor) and 'PAX Counter'

## Add new reading_value_types for the PAX counter 

  PAX WiFi 

  PAX Bluetooth 

  PAX RSSI 
  
  Currently we have 3 PAX counters (not always on) but there may be others in due course. This demonstrates the ability of the map to be flexible regarding which sensors are being viewed at any time.
